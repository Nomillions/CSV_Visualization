# matplotlib_csv
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

this project is to teach students how to use CSV files in python
this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib

In this project you will navigate various methods for viewing temperatures in
Sitka, Alaska and Death Valley, California. 

The python programs sitka_1, _2, and _3 introduce users to Data Visualization with
CSV files, demonstrating how to call information from indexes, draw and name graphs,
and change the colors on those graphs. 

The python program death_valley_1 repeats the culmination of all three Sitka files
into one package, displaying the efficacy of combined graphs and individual graphs 
for MAX and MIN temperatures.

Lastly, the python program is designed to cater to the end-user, asking them which
data-set they want to view. The code within the program is flexible and adjusts
to variations in index values for the DATES, MAX, and MIN values, based on the 
data-set you select.
